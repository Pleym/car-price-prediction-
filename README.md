##  CAR PRICE PREDICTIONS
This is a Python program that predicts car prices based on various features.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Hugging Face:
Car Price Dataset

### Overview
The program uses TensorFlow to create a simple neural network. The architecture consists of fully connected (dense) layers, where all neurons in one layer are linked to the next.

### Status
This project is a work in progress, and I plan to make further improvements in the future.
Currently, the results are satisfactory, but please keep in mind that additional optimizations may be necessary.
